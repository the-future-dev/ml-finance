## Intro to ML modeling
This is the my first approach to machine learning for modeling financial data.

The following code is just a simple experiment to take confidence with the tools of Machine Learning and Finance. It was done before an actual study of either of the subjects to just take down some "a priori" ideas I had about the field.

Follow `main.ipynb` for the modeling logic, but with very low expectations: ideas without field knowledge do not give valuable results.
